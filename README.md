# Project Abstract

This project uses Whisper from OpenAI to generate video subtitles automatically. This can be used to add subtitles to Course Lectures so that we can watch lectures 3x faster or be able to search, rewind the lecture via keywords.

Notice:
This project is currently under construction and would probably be updated regularly.


As of the time writing, this project is workable. Yet some trivial problems shall be fixed soon.


This project is partially based on [m1guelpf/auto-subtitle](https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-subtitle).
