## Project Abstract

This project uses [openai/Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) from OpenAI to generate video subtitles automatically. 

This project adapted some codes from [m1guelpf/auto-subtitle](https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-subtitle).

## Application of This Project
- Generate time-stamped subtitles for your video. Would be helpful in video editing.
