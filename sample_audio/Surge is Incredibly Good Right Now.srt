1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:02.480
Okay, so I'm gonna show you guys some surge gameplay.

2
0:00:02.480 --> 0:00:07.200
If you watch pro matches, they pick surge to counter someone like Poco, Tank, or just

3
0:00:07.200 --> 0:00:08.400
Daniel Grassy Brawler.

4
0:00:08.400 --> 0:00:12.320
But obviously there's some counters to surge, so I don't think it's like one of the best

5
0:00:12.320 --> 0:00:14.720
Brawlers, but still he's really good.

6
0:00:14.720 --> 0:00:16.800
So yeah, let's play some matches.

7
0:00:16.800 --> 0:00:22.000
I mean, surge is pretty good in this spinning mode, so yeah, this clown needs a spinning

8
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:23.000
bro.

9
0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:25.240
I'm pretty sure he's gonna like sneaking.

10
0:00:25.240 --> 0:00:28.240
Yeah, he can't even stay in the bushes, he's pretty good.

11
0:00:28.240 --> 0:00:32.480
Okay, there are more timers, but we can definitely get the kill on this guy, because

12
0:00:32.480 --> 0:00:37.760
it's my super and yeah, thank you for the power cube.

13
0:00:37.760 --> 0:00:41.160
I mean, so far so good, like we're doing well.

14
0:00:41.160 --> 0:00:45.800
But there are another timers on the right, like please play the game.

15
0:00:45.800 --> 0:00:51.800
This guy is even using the thumbs down bro, and yeah, I mean, there are just so many timers.

16
0:00:51.800 --> 0:00:54.840
Okay, so there's a Janet with the gadget.

17
0:00:54.840 --> 0:00:56.400
We need to watch out.

18
0:00:57.120 --> 0:00:59.120
Okay, there was a nice kill.

19
0:00:59.120 --> 0:01:00.920
Got to watch out this bike though.

20
0:01:00.920 --> 0:01:02.720
Gonna use my gadget just in case.

21
0:01:02.720 --> 0:01:04.120
Okay, that was pretty good.

22
0:01:04.120 --> 0:01:08.480
I don't wanna give him any power cubes, so I'm gonna go aggressive.

23
0:01:08.480 --> 0:01:09.840
Maybe he can get the kill?

24
0:01:09.840 --> 0:01:10.600
No.

25
0:01:10.600 --> 0:01:12.880
Okay, he's pretty smart, I guess.

26
0:01:12.880 --> 0:01:14.200
So I'm just gonna regen.

27
0:01:14.200 --> 0:01:20.120
I mean, it's just sort of to get the kill on Nive, especially when he has a gadget, so

28
0:01:20.120 --> 0:01:24.160
some clowns in the mid, they're just spinning, not playing the game.

29
0:01:24.240 --> 0:01:28.640
Let's just get the kill on Nive, like this guy is the reason why I can't go mid.

30
0:01:28.640 --> 0:01:33.520
Yeah, he can't even use the gadget, so now it's just me versus tank.

31
0:01:33.520 --> 0:01:36.280
So it's pretty much over.

32
0:01:36.280 --> 0:01:39.040
They can't really kill me unless I don't have a super.

33
0:01:39.040 --> 0:01:42.640
So we're just gonna stay in the mid and get the kill on there.

34
0:01:42.640 --> 0:01:45.080
We'll give me some ammo.

35
0:01:45.080 --> 0:01:50.040
Okay, and we're gonna get the kill on this dumb, dumb, pretty much well.

36
0:01:50.040 --> 0:01:53.480
I mean, this is definitely the best matchup for surge.

37
0:01:54.320 --> 0:01:58.800
I feel like Brobel is probably his best mode because you're gonna face a lot of tanks,

38
0:01:58.800 --> 0:01:59.800
you know?

39
0:01:59.800 --> 0:02:02.040
And yeah, I gotta watch out this dynamite.

40
0:02:02.040 --> 0:02:04.600
I'm gonna get stunned, that was definitely my bad.

41
0:02:04.600 --> 0:02:07.400
As long as I get my super, I can make a play.

42
0:02:07.400 --> 0:02:11.600
Okay, goodnight, the super and get the kill.

43
0:02:11.600 --> 0:02:18.000
And once you get the speed, there is almost no counter, so you can definitely go more aggressive.

44
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:20.400
We can get the kill on dynamite.

45
0:02:20.400 --> 0:02:26.240
We're gonna use my gadget to stay alive and just wait for the surge to use the super and get the kill.

46
0:02:26.240 --> 0:02:27.960
Kind of popping off right now.

47
0:02:27.960 --> 0:02:31.160
Get the kill again, use the super and the gadget to stay alive.

48
0:02:31.160 --> 0:02:33.960
I think we can definitely score this, please.

49
0:02:33.960 --> 0:02:39.320
Okay, Leon is using the super, so please watch out, BB, please.

50
0:02:39.320 --> 0:02:42.120
No, he's gonna go down.

51
0:02:42.120 --> 0:02:44.320
But it doesn't really matter, I can get the kill.

52
0:02:44.320 --> 0:02:48.120
Gonna watch out this super, pass it to Nida and he's gonna score.

53
0:02:48.120 --> 0:02:50.440
We are gonna face some sweaty comp.

54
0:02:50.440 --> 0:02:54.480
Like Poco, Lu and Ash are really good, so.

55
0:02:54.480 --> 0:03:00.720
Okay, got my super, so I can go aggressive with the super here and, okay.

56
0:03:00.720 --> 0:03:03.040
I actually got a double kill, so that's really good.

57
0:03:03.040 --> 0:03:07.400
I mean, we got the mid control, so we just gotta hold it.

58
0:03:07.400 --> 0:03:10.720
I'm gonna save my super so they can't go aggressive, you know?

59
0:03:10.720 --> 0:03:11.960
Yeah, let's do what I can do here.

60
0:03:11.960 --> 0:03:17.240
I'm gonna use my super and maybe make a play with the gadget, please.

61
0:03:17.280 --> 0:03:19.560
Okay, got the kill on Ash.

62
0:03:19.560 --> 0:03:22.800
I'm kinda popping off right now.

63
0:03:22.800 --> 0:03:24.960
And get a kill on Poco as well.

64
0:03:24.960 --> 0:03:28.560
Yeah, we're winning by 70%, so I think we should be fine.

65
0:03:28.560 --> 0:03:32.560
This Frank needs to stop feeding the loose super.

66
0:03:32.560 --> 0:03:37.040
Like, they're just so many loose super on the map right now.

67
0:03:37.040 --> 0:03:40.160
I think we should be fine still, we're winning by 60%.

68
0:03:40.160 --> 0:03:43.960
Just get into the zone and, yeah, stay there.

69
0:03:43.960 --> 0:03:47.400
I don't have a gadget, so I can't really carry, but.

70
0:03:47.400 --> 0:03:50.680
Like, now we just stay like, like, just stop dying, please.

71
0:03:50.680 --> 0:03:53.200
Frank, our bow went down again.

72
0:03:53.200 --> 0:03:56.040
Like, we just need four more percent.

73
0:03:57.040 --> 0:03:58.640
Please stop dying.

74
0:03:58.640 --> 0:04:02.000
Like Frank, this bow is gonna go down as well.

75
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:03.840
This is gonna be actually the close match.

76
0:04:03.840 --> 0:04:05.480
There's no way.

77
0:04:05.480 --> 0:04:07.640
Just get into the zone, please, okay?

78
0:04:07.640 --> 0:04:08.880
That's how you do it.

79
0:04:08.880 --> 0:04:13.000
Okay, we're facing another sweaty comp, so just give me the Ash lane,

80
0:04:13.000 --> 0:04:14.280
then we should be fine.

81
0:04:14.280 --> 0:04:17.640
Okay, we're facing Ash, so like, once you get a super,

82
0:04:17.640 --> 0:04:20.040
you can just go aggressive and use the gadget.

83
0:04:20.040 --> 0:04:24.160
Okay, got my super, and now I can use the super in the gadget

84
0:04:24.160 --> 0:04:25.000
and get a kill.

85
0:04:25.000 --> 0:04:28.280
Okay, our crow is gonna go down, but it doesn't really matter.

86
0:04:28.280 --> 0:04:31.560
I can definitely hold my lane, so just keep the distance

87
0:04:31.560 --> 0:04:34.520
until you get a super, and once you get a super,

88
0:04:34.520 --> 0:04:35.520
you can go aggressive.

89
0:04:35.520 --> 0:04:37.560
This crow is gonna use the super.

90
0:04:37.560 --> 0:04:41.240
I'm gonna go aggressive as well, since they wasted all the ammo.

91
0:04:41.280 --> 0:04:43.120
Okay, let's see what we can do here.

92
0:04:43.120 --> 0:04:44.520
They're all on the right.

93
0:04:44.520 --> 0:04:46.920
I'm gonna use the super and use the gadget

94
0:04:46.920 --> 0:04:49.160
and get a double kill, okay?

95
0:04:49.160 --> 0:04:52.920
Kinda popping off right now, and we can get a kill on Pany as well

96
0:04:52.920 --> 0:04:54.360
with the super, okay?

97
0:04:55.640 --> 0:04:57.520
Got another kill on Ash.

98
0:04:57.520 --> 0:05:00.560
Honestly, I kinda carried the match, and yeah,

99
0:05:00.560 --> 0:05:02.240
there was a pretty clean match.

100
0:05:02.240 --> 0:05:05.520
We were facing some sweaty team, but we were gonna place

101
0:05:05.520 --> 0:05:08.240
some basketball, and we got the underdog, okay?

102
0:05:08.240 --> 0:05:12.400
So, that means we're facing some decent players, I think.

103
0:05:12.400 --> 0:05:15.480
I don't have a good matchup, so I need to get my super

104
0:05:15.480 --> 0:05:18.040
as soon as possible, so I can get the speed.

105
0:05:19.440 --> 0:05:21.400
Our teammates are gonna go down,

106
0:05:21.400 --> 0:05:25.320
at least I got my super, so let's see what I can do here.

107
0:05:25.320 --> 0:05:27.920
I'm gonna go down to Colette, but really good gadget by Fang.

108
0:05:27.920 --> 0:05:32.760
I mean, they do have a really hard counter comp, so yeah.

109
0:05:32.760 --> 0:05:34.600
Nevermind, this Fang is just different.

110
0:05:34.600 --> 0:05:37.000
Okay, they're using the dumpstown, I think we're good.

111
0:05:37.000 --> 0:05:42.120
I'm gonna use the super, I almost went down to B, but we're still alive, you know?

112
0:05:43.240 --> 0:05:46.000
And I'm gonna use the gadget to stay alive.

113
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:47.880
Just tank the B shot, yep.

114
0:05:47.880 --> 0:05:52.120
And yeah, looking so far, our Fang is popping off.

115
0:05:53.120 --> 0:05:56.320
We can definitely score here, gonna pass it to both.

116
0:05:56.320 --> 0:06:00.000
And he's not gonna score, but I'm gonna use my super here

117
0:06:00.000 --> 0:06:03.880
to get a kill, and this Fang is just a goat.

118
0:06:03.880 --> 0:06:06.600
You can just tank some shots, so you can score.

119
0:06:06.600 --> 0:06:07.440
Let's go.

120
0:06:07.440 --> 0:06:11.720
Yeah, we're facing some sweaty team again, yeah, GG.

121
0:06:11.720 --> 0:06:14.240
Okay, so this is probably the only mode

122
0:06:14.240 --> 0:06:21.760
that you need to avoid, because I feel like all the maps right now in Naka,

123
0:06:21.760 --> 0:06:27.920
they're all kinda open maps, so you can get easily outraged by so many brawlers.

124
0:06:27.920 --> 0:06:33.320
So you need to bring this gadget and get a speed, so you can get a super.

125
0:06:33.360 --> 0:06:35.360
But like once you get this super, like I said,

126
0:06:35.360 --> 0:06:39.800
there are almost no counters, so you can definitely do some work.

127
0:06:39.800 --> 0:06:42.760
Okay, we kinda push them back, they're using the thumbs down.

128
0:06:43.800 --> 0:06:45.840
I'm kinda dodging so many shots.

129
0:06:48.320 --> 0:06:50.680
And we can definitely get a kill here, okay?

130
0:06:50.680 --> 0:06:53.720
Got a kill and a block, gonna use the super to stay alive.

131
0:06:53.720 --> 0:06:56.160
Now we can pinch, grumb here.

132
0:06:57.160 --> 0:06:58.520
Okay, nice kill.

133
0:07:00.160 --> 0:07:02.720
And this is 2B1 situation, so...

134
0:07:02.720 --> 0:07:04.400
I don't think we're gonna lose this one.

135
0:07:09.680 --> 0:07:11.280
Okay, that was pretty close.

136
0:07:11.280 --> 0:07:13.800
This ghost got a super, so...

137
0:07:14.760 --> 0:07:19.520
He's gonna use the super actually, and actually he's kinda popping off.

138
0:07:20.240 --> 0:07:22.000
We need to watch out for sure.

139
0:07:23.040 --> 0:07:25.440
Okay, actually I'm gonna go down to ghost.

140
0:07:25.440 --> 0:07:26.720
That was really close.

141
0:07:26.720 --> 0:07:30.800
Yeah, I mean, now I got my super, so I can just use the gadget

142
0:07:30.800 --> 0:07:36.080
to get the next range and just dodging so many shots right now.

143
0:07:37.080 --> 0:07:38.680
Brom, different with the surge.

144
0:07:39.640 --> 0:07:40.640
Yeah, got a kill.

145
0:07:40.640 --> 0:07:42.840
They're gonna use the thumbs down, we're good.

146
0:07:42.840 --> 0:07:44.960
Gonna get another kill and...

147
0:07:45.840 --> 0:07:48.640
Honestly, I kinda carry the match again.

148
0:07:48.640 --> 0:07:50.040
Yeah.

149
0:07:50.040 --> 0:07:53.320
We were facing another good team, so GG.

150
0:07:53.320 --> 0:07:55.320
And yeah, thank you guys for watching,

151
0:07:55.320 --> 0:07:57.760
and I'll see you guys on the next one.
